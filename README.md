# Retro Games - NES Game Source Code
 This is the source code for my NES game made with NESMaker

This is project will not work in a stock version of NESMaker, you must follow the steps outlined (here)[https://nesmaker.nerdboard.nl/2023/11/24/faq-can-nesmaker-do-zapper-games/] on your own install of NESMaker to have these assets work. The ROM can be played in any NES emulator that has support for a NES Zapper in controller slot 2.
